# Auto Spec
Auto Spec is an interactive web application that visualizes performance car metrics and explores brand relationships. Built with React and TypeScript and powered by D3.js, the app offers:

-A scatter plot for real-time comparison of car metrics (e.g., horsepower, torque) with customizable axes.
-Detailed data point information on hover, displayed in a responsive table.
-A circular packing visualization that dynamically clusters car models by brand using D3.js force simulation.
